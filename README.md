# Ulti-miR v1: An integrated, ontology-mapped database of miRNA associations with miRNA–disease similarity analytics

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators involved in numerous biological processes, making them significant biomarkers and therapeutic targets across a broad spectrum of diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular disorders, and neurological conditions. Over the past two decades, a multitude of specialised miRNA databases have been developed. Pioneer resources like HMDD remain the go-to for literature-curated associations, while recent platforms such as PlasmiR, add > 1000 blood-borne miRNA biomarkers spanning 112 diseases. Together, these datasets synthesise data from low-throughput validations, high-throughput screens, and computational predictions, giving researchers multiple vantage points on miRNA pathobiology.

However, the miRNA–disease landscape remains fragmented: databases rarely integrate heterogeneous data types; disease, drug, and gene nomenclature differ; and non-standardised miRNA identifiers abound, complicating cross-study analyses. Annual miRBase revisions rename or retire entries, further eroding identifier consistency, and none of the existing resources provides built-in disease-similarity metrics based on miRNA profiles. To address these gaps, we developed an up-to-date, ontology-mapped repository that merges heterogeneous sources into a unified schema and delivers seamless programmatic and graphical access for downstream analytics.

In our comprehensive miRNA database, we aggregated data from 11 publicly available databases, encompassing 109381 unique miRNA-disease associations as of April 2025. Raw data ingestion was followed by a comprehensive pipeline for data normalisation, which included identifier normalization, ontology-based mapping, and duplicate removal. Our mapping workflow combined NCBO Annotator for disease annotations using MeSH,  and custom scripts for miRBase harmonisation, achieving mappings for 2236 unique diseases (96%) and over 4500 miRNAs (62%). The backend is a versatile SQL schema that captures miRNA–disease, miRNA–target, miRNA–lncRNA, SNP–disease and other epigenetic relationships, enabling multifaceted analyses across all data types. 
Using our miRNA-disease association data, we conducted disease similarity analyses based on the Jaccard Index, quantifying the extent of similarity between disease miRNA dysregulation profiles, an analysis previously unavailable in any public miRNA resource. In our application, we convert these similarity scores into distance metrics and apply t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, enabling visual exploration of complex disease relationships. Multiple clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Birch, Hierarchical, Gaussian Mixture) then group diseases with similar miRNA signatures, highlighting patterns that may reflect shared molecular mechanisms or biological pathways. These clusters, coupled with interactive heatmaps and a network-based similarity graph, allow users to identify tightly connected disease groups, explore comorbid patterns, and prioritize diseases with high connectivity or similarity. This integrative approach adds interpretability to raw association data and facilitates hypothesis generation for future biomedical research or therapeutic insights. 
Our platform is designed to maximize usability, transparency, and reproducibility. All code and processed datasets are openly available through public repositories (GitHub, Dropbox), ensuring full traceability and reuse. The database schema and content are well-documented and intuitively organized, allowing researchers to perform personal or large-scale analyses without extensive data wrangling. All associations are verified and standardized using current, authoritative sources, such as miRBase for miRNAs, Disease Ontology and MeSH for diseases, providing robust data quality. Two intuitive Streamlit interfaces enhance user interaction: the first supports flexible and powerful SQL-based queries without extensive technical expertise, allowing results to be easily exported in CSV format; the second offers built-in similarity analyses through interactive, downloadable heatmaps and network visualisations, enabling rapid exploration of disease relationships based on shared miRNA profiles. The database schema accommodates multiple dimensions, including miRNA–disease, drug–target, SNP–disease, and miRNA–lncRNA interactions, significantly reducing manual preprocessing and accelerating integrative bioinformatics workflows.
